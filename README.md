Project I made when I was 13 years old upon request by a neuropsychiatrist. 

The software aims to provide a way for the doctor to store data relatively to each patient (age, phone number, illness etc) and to print out prescriptions.

At the time, the doctor needed it as soon as possible so I didn't really put too much effort into the design, the goal was to get something that worked well quickly, that allowed to store a large quantity 
of patients whilst easily keeping track of each folder. Furthermore, the way the software operates allows one to store each folder on softwares like OneDrive to be able to keep track of it anywhere.

I do not plan on making improvements to it as of now as the software has actively been used by a neuropsychiatrist for the past 6+ years without any issue.
